# FGM

This is a test project for the [Filament Google Maps](https://github.com/cheesegrits/filament-google-maps) package
for [Filament PHP](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) (an application builder for Laravel).

This project exercises and demonstrates all the features of Filament Google Maps, and also includes
a Dusk test suite for features which cannot be tested in the package test suite itself.

In order to install, seed and run this project, you will need a Google Maps API key.
