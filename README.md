## About FGM

This is a test app for the [Filament Google Maps](https://github.com/cheesegrits/filament-google-maps) package, which itself is a plugin for [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/), an application builder for Laravel

This app is mostly used for testing by the FGM package maintainer, but as it exercises every feature of the FGM package it is made available as a potentially useful resource for anyone using the FGM package in Filament.

Install like any Laravel app, but also reference the installation instructions in the FGM github regarding Google Maps API keys, which you will need before attempting to seed the project, as seeding uses live API calls.
In particular, take note of the advice to set quotas on your API key(s) to avoid any unexpected high usage bills.
